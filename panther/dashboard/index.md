## Overview

The dashboard provides an overview of the current contents of your event console.

![](./dash-updating.mp4)



## Severities

At the top of the dashboard, there is a row of counters for events
processed in the event logs associated with each severity.  These
counters reflect the number of unique events logged, and will not
increase if the same event log is processed multiple times.


## Event Groups

Counters are displayed in this section for events matching any created
event groups -- along with one special counter for events having no
associated group and another for all events processed.

The counters reflect the total numbers of unique event log entries in
each of the respective groups, with the coloured bars representing the
relative proportions of events having each of the severity levels. The
actual numerical breakdowns can be inspected by moving the mouse
pointer over each row.

## Activity Stream

The activity stream logs user interaction with Panther, including:

* Event acknowledgements and unacknowledgements
* Event assignments
* Event severity changes
* Event clearances
* Event deletions

## Inventory

The inventory lists the names of hosts that have connected to Panther,
and the last times they were seen.
