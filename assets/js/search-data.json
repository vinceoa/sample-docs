Any events with a matching identifier will be grouped together, and the corresponding event tally will increase by 1. If no matching event identifier is found, then a new event is created. Timestamps are also stored for each event. Please note that when events are deduplicated via the identifier field, some information may be lost. For example, the PID of a process can change regularly, but is not included in the identifier by default, so multiple PIDs may aggregate into a single event. Severity Mapping . Syslog logging levels need to be mapped to event console severities as there is not a one to one relationship between them, and the scale is also inverted. Syslog levels are defined from 7 (debug) to 0 (emergency). Event console severities are from 5 (critical) to 0 (clear).

The transforms allow pre-defined functions to be applied to event console fields before rules processing takes place.

    "content": "Panther has been designed and developed by Open Answers to meet our operational needs and those of our customers, having provided support and system monitoring services over three decades. Within the open source and SaaS monitoring space there are myriads of monitoring tools available. The typical monitoring toolset implements active monitoring, where the status of a component is checked or a synthetic transaction is tested repeatedly on a schedule. The outcome of that probe/status check/transaction etc is an active monitoring event. A passive event is an event of interest within an application or system that is generally triggered by real system or user behaviour. See some Example Events. The typical IT operational support team needs an event management platform in its toolset - a console and dashboard where events of all kinds can be aggregated, managed and assessed - all configured through simple rules that help support teams decide what the priority events are and where action needs to be taken. In a constantly changing IT support environment, the take-on of new applications and systems to support means that it is not possible to predict what kind of events (logged messages, errors, exceptions etc) may occur during day to day operations. To deal with this uncertainty, effective support teams will devise ways to ensure that events generated by critical systems and applications are checked regularly, or as soon as they occur. The open source and SaaS monitoring tools landscape is lacking when it comes to monitoring events in this way. There has traditionally been a very limited choice of expensive and difficult to implement “Enterprise” event management tools of this type that may be categorised as “manager of managers”. More recently, Log Management tools have appeared on the market which provide a way to aggregate and search historical log information. These are effective for investigating issues but have the limitation that they are not efficient for use in first-line support scenarios. By surfacing events of all types in one place, in a way that makes them easy to manage, Panther provides the perfect complement to System Monitoring, Log Management, Time-series database and Ticketing tools. Example Events . | Event Type | Example | . | Business Event | Customer unable to make a purchase | . | Operating system event | Filesystem is full | . | Operational event | Scheduled job finished unsuccessfully | . | Security event | Suspicious behavior detected by Intrusion Detection System | . | Application event | Application generated exception | . | Hardware event | UPS battery low | . | Network event | Switch detected spanning-tree loop | .

    "content": "Thousands (or millions) of events happen across your IT infrastructure every day. Why? Because an event is simply a change to the state of an IT service or configuration item (CI) that is significant to its management. A server moving from online to idle could be an event, or the completion of a regular server maintenance script, or even an unexpected state at the end of a transaction. They’re worth knowing about, and there may even be an action you wish to take as a result. The objective of event management is to detect events, analyse them, and determine the right control action (if any). By doing so, the event management process also provides a strong foundation for service assurance, reporting, and service improvement. It’s important to know, though, that monitoring and event management are not the same thing. Monitoring is certainly a component of event management, in that it is a useful way to detect events as they occur. Event management, on the other hand, is focused on extracting meaning out of events, to help IT take appropriate actions (when required).

When signing-up you will be asked to choose a unique name for your Console which will then be accessible at https://{your-console-name}.panther.support. Using Panther for the First Time . Login for the first time as the user admin using the password that was used during Sign-up - this is the default user account that will be used to administer Panther for the first time. The first screen that you will see is the Dashboard, which will look like this: . Clicking on Open Console will take you to the Console, which will look like this: … this example shows that the Panther instance currently has two events in it. These particular messages are coming from the instance’s internal syslogd and http agents which will send periodic “keep-alive” events to indicate that they are healthy. Here, Agent http is alive and Agent syslogd are the details of the event, contained within the summary field (see next section). Double-click on an event to explore it a bit more. Anatomy of an Event . A Panther Event is comprised of a number of data fields that are analagous to The Syslog Protocol. | Field | Meaning | Example value | . | _id | Internal Panther ID for the event | 5d8a4143f9f0b20100f778f9 | . | acknowledged | Indicates whether the event has been acknowledged | false | . | agent | The agent that received the event | syslogd | . | external_id | A reference to an external identifier (e.g. incident reference) | OA:12345 | . | first_occurrence | Date/time when the first event was received | 2019-09-24T16:16:03.825Z | . | last_occurrence | Date/time when the last event was received | 2019-10-04T12:22:49.063Z | . | group | Grouping applied to this event (determined by Group Rules) | Windows Servers | . | identifier | Unique identifier for this event (used for de-duplication) | 10740737389554512696 | . | node | Hostname of the device/server that originated the event | MYWINSERVER123 | . | owner | The panther user that has taken ownership of this event | dave | . | severity | Event Severity (0-5) | 5 _(Warning)_ | . | state_change | Date/time when the last change to the event occurred | 2019-10-04T12:22:49.066Z | . | summary | Event details | ERROR_OUTOFMEMORY: Not enough storage is available to complete this operation | . | tag | Name of program or process that generated the event | Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General | . | tally | Count of event occurrences | 1416 | . By default, a unique Event is defined by the combination of the fields: {node}:{severity}:{tag}:{summary}. Multiple events that have the same values for these fields will be treated as the same event, with a counter (tally) incremented for each occurrence. Simple Rules can be used to adjust the contents of these fields (for example, to remove unique data from the summary field) which allows Events to be de-duplicated and enriched, making them easy to manage.

In order to facilitate this, archives of configuration files are available for download from the Panther admin page. More detailed information on the download procedure is available, along with configuration guides for each supported system, in the client configuration section. REST API .
